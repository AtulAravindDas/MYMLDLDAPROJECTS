Presently,I am an incoming Fall 2024 MS Data Science student in Boston University. I have done a few projects in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Analytics. It covers topics like cricket analysis and Financial Analysis. Some results may not be displayed along with the Colab notebook, so check the PDF documents to see the executed outputs. The datasets to implement the codes have been provided in this repository along with the .ipynb files containing the codes. Feel free to cobnact me for more information, as well as any potential projeects. Looking forward to do more projects in the near future. 

P.S. I really want to delve deeper into concepts like Image Processing and Audio processing. Really appreciate any guidance given to me.
